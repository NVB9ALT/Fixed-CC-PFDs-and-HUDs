This is the repo for the CC PFD/HUD fix for the Realism Addon (although it's not included in that *yet*). Copy and paste into the console. For almost every CC aircraft it will make the PFD/HUD read accurate altitude, VS, Mach, etc. It is an enter-and-forget sort of thing; once you enter it into the console you shouldn't need to do so again (unless you reload GeoFS ofc).

NOTE: If you discover an issue, a bug, or if a PFD or HUD needs to be rescaled (too big/small), please let me know by submitting an issue under "Issues" in the top bar.
